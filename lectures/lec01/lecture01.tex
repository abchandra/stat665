Linear Models is both a capstone to the 241/242 sequence
and the breadth to compliment 610's depth. It also
serves as a link between the statistical inference courses
and the applied data analysis courses.\pause

Topics will be oriented around linear models (obviously) but
the course is somewhat of a hodgepodge of topics and applications.

{\bf Suggested Prerequisites:} \pause
\begin{itemize}\setlength\itemsep{0em}
\item Linear Algebra at the level of MATH 222 \pause
\item Statistical theory at the level of STAT 242 \pause
\item Some familiarity with a statistical software or programming language, preferably R

{\bf Grading}

\begin{itemize}\setlength\itemsep{0em}
\item 70\% Problem Sets (10\% each) \pause
\item 15\% Mid-Term I (2015-10-12) \pause
\item 15\% Mid-Term II (2015-11-18)
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile] \frametitle{}

{\bf Problem Sets:} \\
Problem sets are assigned roughly once every two weeks;
this yields a total of 7 sets.
You may discuss problem sets with other students, but must write up your
own solutions. This means that you should have no need to look at other
student's final written solutions.

\bigskip

Tentative due dates for problem sets: 09-14, 09-28, 10-05, 10-19, 11-02,
11-09 and 12-16. The final assignment is due the last day of reading period
and may be handed in to the office at 24 Hillhouse.

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile] \frametitle{}

{\bf STAT 312 vs. STAT 612} \pause

Same requirements and assignments; final grades will be determined
separately. \pause

I strongly encourage undergraduates to have taken linear
algebra and at least STAT 238 or STAT 242. \pause

I will teach with a graduate focus only in the sense that we
will be concerned with {\bf content} over {\bf grades}.

Consider observing pairs of points $(x_i,y_i)$, which we
can graphically represent by a scatter plot.

\vfill

\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{img/fig01.pdf}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile] \frametitle{}

A {\bf simple linear model} assumes that the mean of each
$y_i$ conditioned on $x_i$ is a linear function of $x_i$.

\vfill

\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{img/fig01.pdf}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile] \frametitle{}

Visually, we can think of this as a line through the data.

\vfill

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile] \frametitle{}

For a reasonable fit, the {\bf residuals}, shown in red,
should have a mean close to zero. The should also be `small'
in some sense.

\vfill

\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{img/fig03.pdf}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile] \frametitle{}

Symbolically, the simple linear regression model assumes
that:
\begin{align}
\mathbb{E}(y_i|x_i) &= \alpha + x_i \cdot \beta
\end{align}
The goal, typically, is to find point estimates and conduct
inference on the unknown parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$.

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile] \frametitle{}

Classic examples of quantities modeled with simple linear regression:
\begin{itemize}
\item College GPA $\sim$ SAT scores
\item Change in GDP $\sim$ change in unemployment
\item House price $\sim$ number of bedrooms
\item Species heart weight $\sim$ species body weight
\item Fatilities per year $\sim$ speed limit
\end{itemize}

\pause
Notice that these simple linear regressions are simplifications of
more complex relationships between the variables in question.

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile] \frametitle{}

What sign would be expect of $\beta$ (the slope) from
each of these?
\begin{itemize}
\item College GPA $\sim$ SAT scores \pause  $\quad{\color{solarized@green} \beta > 0}$
\item Change in GDP $\sim$ change in unemployment \pause $\quad{\color{solarized@red}\beta < 0}$
\item House price $\sim$ number of bedrooms \pause $\quad{\color{solarized@green}\beta > 0}$
\item Species heart weight $\sim$ species body weight \pause $\quad{\color{solarized@green}\beta > 0}$
\item Fatilities per year $\sim$ speed limit \pause $\quad{\color{solarized@red}\beta < 0}$
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile] \frametitle{}

A {\bf (general) linear model} is similar to the simple variant, but
with a multivariate $x \in \mathbb{R}^p$ and a mean given by a hyperplane
in place of a single line.
\begin{align}
\mathbb{E}(y_i|x_i) &= \alpha + \sum_j \quad x_{i,j} \cdot \beta_j
\end{align}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile] \frametitle{}


\begin{itemize}
\item General principles are the same as the simple case \pause
\item Math is more difficult because we need to use matrices \pause
\item Interpretation is more difficult because the $\beta_j$ are effects
conditional on the other variables
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile] \frametitle{}

For example, consider these two variable regressions:
\begin{itemize}
\item College GPA $\sim$ SAT scores, secondary school GPA
\item Change in GDP $\sim$ change in unemployment, inflation
\item House price $\sim$ number of bedrooms, area of the house
\item Species heart weight $\sim$ species body weight, species height
\item Fatalities per year $\sim$ speed limit, minimum legal speed
\end{itemize}

\pause
Many would retain the same signs as the simple linear regression, but
the magnitudes would be smaller. In some cases, it is possible for
the relationship to flip directions when a second (highly correlated)
variable is added.

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile] \frametitle{}

What might be an explanation of the following signs:
\begin{itemize}
\item College GPA $\sim$ {\color{solarized@red} SAT scores}, {\color{solarized@green} secondary school GPA} \pause
\item House price $\sim$ {\color{solarized@green} number of bedrooms},
      {\color{solarized@red} area of the house} \pause
\item Species heart weight $\sim$ {\color{solarized@green} species body weight}, {\color{solarized@red} species height}
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile] \frametitle{}

Extensions to linear models include: \pause
\begin{itemize} \setlength\itemsep{0em}
\item generalized linear models:
\begin{align*}
\mathbb{E} (y | x) &= g^{-1}(x^t \beta)
\end{align*} \pause
\item additive models:
\begin{align*}
\mathbb{E} (y | x) &= f_1(x_1) + f_2(x_2) + \cdots + f_k(x_k)
\end{align*} \pause
\item Generalized Additive Model for Location, Scale and Shape (GAMLSS):
\begin{align*}
\mathbb{E} (y | x) &= f_{1,1}(x_1) + f_{1,1}(x_2) + \cdots + f_{1,1}(x_k) \\
\mathbb{E} (y^2 | x) &= f_{1,2}(x_1) + f_{2,2}(x_2) + \cdots + f_{k,2}(x_k) \\
&\vdots \\
\mathbb{E} (y^q | x) &= f_{1,q}(x_1) + f_{2,q}(x_2) + \cdots + f_{k,q}(x_k) \\

Machine learning is a closely related field to statistics; most
researches that I know think of there being a spectrum of research
between the two rather than a clear dividing line. \pause

being primarily concerned with {\bf inference} and machine learning
with {\bf prediction}.

With powerful methods such as neural networks, support vector

linear models in machine learning?

{\color{yaleblue}\fontsize{16pt}{20pt}\selectfont Answer}

Yes!

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile] \frametitle{}

{\bf \# 1.} When the number of parameters is close to or exceeds the
number of observations, particularly if the data matrix $X$ is sparse.

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile] \frametitle{}

{\bf \# 2.} Creating meta-variables as an input to other ML techniques
or to blend the outputs from ensemble learning.

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile] \frametitle{}

{\bf \# 3.} Working with data that have difficult to
work with distributions, such as quantile regression on
heavy-tailed errors (i.e., Cauchy, Lévy).

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile] \frametitle{}

{\bf \# 4.} Projecting into high dimensional spaces (where often
we have more predictors that observations and spare data matrices).

Consider the following set of data points $(x_i, y_i)$. The relationship
between $x$ and $y$ is highly non-linear.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The true mean (from which I simulated) is given by:

\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{img/fig05.pdf}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile] \frametitle{}

It would at first seem that we can't model this response with a linear
model. However, that is not the case because it is only $\beta$ that needs to be
linear, not the $x$ values. \pause

For example, the following is a linear model:
\begin{align*}
\mathbb{E} (y | x) &= \beta_0 + \beta_1 x^1 + \beta_2 x^2 + \beta_3 x^3
\end{align*}
Which will fit a polynomial to the data.

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile] \frametitle{}

An alternative that works better here, is a Fourier basis:
\begin{align*}
\mathbb{E} (y | x) &= \beta_0 + \sum_{j=1}^{k} \beta_j \cos (j * x) + \sum_{j=1}^k \beta_{k+j} \sin (j * x)
\end{align*}
And we can adjust the fit appropriately by specifying the
order $k$.
